🚀 100 Days of DSA Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of DSA Challenge repository! 🎯

This is my personal journey where I solve 6 DSA problems every single day, consistently for 100 days. The main goal is to master problem-solving skills, improve my coding speed & accuracy, and get ready for technical interviews at top product-based companies.

🌟 Challenge Rules

I will solve 6 problems daily across different topics.

The 6 problems will cover:

🧮 Array / String

📚 Stack / Queue

🔗 Linked List

🌳 Tree

🌐 Graph

📊 Dynamic Programming (DP)

Every day’s set will have a mix of 2 Easy, 2 Medium, and 2 Hard problems.

I will push solutions daily to this repository.

No problem will be repeated throughout the 100 days.

🎯 My Goals

Build strong problem-solving skills.

Revise and master all major DSA topics.

Prepare for FAANG & top MNC interviews.

Become consistent with daily coding habits.

Showcase my progress publicly on GitHub.

📅 Daily Structure

Solve 6 fresh problems (around 2–3 hours daily).

Write clean, optimized, and well-commented code.

Push solutions to GitHub every day.

Track progress with logs in this repository.
